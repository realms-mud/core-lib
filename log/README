Error logs and other items saved via the log service will be placed in 
this directory.

To create your own custom log files, you can do so in code like this:

void someFunc()
{
    ...
    getService("log")->log("MyLogName", "Some message");
    ...
}

The log "MyLogName" will then show up in this directory and will have
an entry added whenever someFunc() is called.
