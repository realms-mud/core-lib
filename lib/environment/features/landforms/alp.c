        "typically found at elevations where trees cannot grow but grasses "
        "and alpine plants thrive during the brief summer season. This "
        "elevated grassland provides seasonal grazing for livestock and "
        "supports specialized alpine flora adapted to harsh mountain "
        "conditions. The alp's beauty lies in its contrast to the rocky "
        "peaks above and forested slopes below, creating a pastoral oasis "
        "in the high mountains. Snow covers the alp for much of the year, "
        "but during the short growing season it bursts into life with "
        "wildflowers and lush grass that has sustained mountain communities "
        "for generations.");
