        "covered walkways that allow movement regardless of weather. Gardens "
        "provide both food and medicinal herbs, essential for the community's "
        "self-sufficiency. Unlike the grander abbey, this monastery emphasizes "

        "spiritual discipline of its residents, who have chosen to step away "
        "from worldly concerns in favor of prayer and inner focus."
