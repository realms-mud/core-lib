        "placed. Narrow windows on the upper levels suggest observation posts, "
        "while the top platform offers a commanding 360-degree view of the "
        "surroundings. The stonework shows expert craftsmanship, with larger "
        "blocks at the base tapering to slightly smaller ones higher up. A "

        "entry point to this formidable structure."
