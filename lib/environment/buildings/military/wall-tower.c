        " with the chill wind whistling through its arrow slits and guards "

        " with snow gathering on the crenellations and icicles forming briefly "

        "attackers while remaining protected. The top features a crenellated "
        "parapet, providing cover for guards while allowing them to observe or "

        "fighting platforms."
