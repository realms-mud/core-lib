        ". The first light of day touches the central tower while the outer "
        "walls remain in shadow, emphasizing the keep's imposing height",
        ". At dawn, the keep's silhouette stands stark against the brightening "
        "sky, guards visible as small figures atop the battlements"

        ". Morning light reveals the defensive nature of the structure, from "
        "arrow slits to murder holes above the iron-bound gate",
        ". The keep's stone walls appear golden in the morning sun, belying "
        "their grim purpose of protection and defense"

    addTimeOfDayDescription("noon", ({
        ". At midday, the keep casts a sharply defined shadow, the stone walls "
        "radiating the heat they've absorbed from the sun",
        ". The noon sun highlights the weathered stonework, showing repairs and "
        "additions made over generations of defensive vigilance"

        ". The afternoon light emphasizes the substantial thickness of the "
        "walls, each stone carefully placed for maximum strength",

        ". As evening approaches, torches and braziers are lit along the "
        "battlements, establishing a ring of light above the darkening walls",
        ". The keep takes on a more forbidding aspect in the fading light, its "
        "purpose as a final defensive position never more apparent"
        }));

    addTimeOfDayDescription("dusk", ({
        ". At dusk, the keep becomes a massive shadow against the sky, only its "
        "outline and the occasional torch marking its presence",
        ". The portcullis is lowered at dusk, the heavy grate cutting off access "
        "until the safety of morning light returns"

        ". By night, the keep is a dark fortress broken only by torchlight "
        "along the battlements where guards maintain their watch",

        "the skilled masonry of the defensive structure"

        " with heat radiating from the sun-baked stones and the garrison "
        "grateful for the cool interior behind thick walls",

        "kept clear for defensive visibility"

        " with fallen leaves gathering at the base of the walls, unable to "
        "breach the keep's defenses any more than an enemy could",
        " as autumn winds find every arrow slit and embrasure, the sounds of "
        "their passage creating an eerie chorus through the stonework"
        }));

    addSeasonDescription("winter", ({
        " with snow outlining the battlements and icicles forming deadly "
        "spikes below the machicolations",
        " where winter transforms the already formidable structure into "
        "something even more forbidding, cold stone against white snow"

        "pierce the thick walls strategically, while a single heavily fortified "
        "gate provides the only entrance. The stonework shows generations of "
        "care and maintenance, for this structure was built to withstand both "
        "time and siege. Defensive features include machicolations above the "
        "gate, murder holes, and a deep ditch surrounding the base of the walls."
