#### Traits System Overview

Traits in this MUD represent a sophisticated character development system that 
encompasses everything from personality characteristics to temporary magical
effects. The system provides deep character customization through permanent traits,
temporary effects, and research-based enhancements that fundamentally alter 
character abilities, skills, behaviors, and interactions with the world.

The traits system operates on multiple interconnected levels:
1. **Permanent Traits**: Long-lasting character characteristics that define who the character is
2. **Temporary Traits**: Time-limited effects from spells, potions, diseases, or environmental conditions
3. **Sustained Traits**: Effects maintained by active research or magical practices
4. **Research Integration**: Traits that unlock research trees or are granted by research completion
5. **Combat Integration**: Traits that directly affect combat calculations and abilities
6. **Social Integration**: Traits that influence NPC interactions and faction relationships

##### Traits Inheritance Hierarchy

All traits inherit from a base trait class that provides comprehensive validation and functionality:

~~~c
inherit "/lib/modules/traits/baseTrait.c";
~~~

This base class provides:
- **Trait validation**: Ensures all required properties are properly set and valid
- **Bonus system**: Manages complex stat bonuses, penalties, and modifiers
- **Prerequisites system**: Handles requirements for trait acquisition including race, research, and other traits
- **Research integration**: Links traits to research trees and sustained effects
- **Combat integration**: Provides extra attacks, damage bonuses, and special abilities
- **Display system**: Formats trait information for player viewing

##### System File Locations

The traits system is extensively organized across multiple directories and files:

###### Core System Files

~~~c
private string *validTraitTypes = ({ "health", "educational", "personality", 
    "genetic", "professional", "guild", "role", "effect", "sustained effect",
    "background", "racial", "persona" });
~~~

activities that last as long as the sustaining condition remains active.

##### Creating Basic Traits

All traits must inherit from the base trait class and implement a Setup() 
method that defines the trait's properties:

inherit "/lib/modules/traits/baseTrait.c";

protected void Setup()
{
    addSpecification("name", "attractive");
    addSpecification("description", "You are naturally attractive and "
        "appealing to others. This gives you a bonus to charisma and "
        "makes social interactions easier.");
    addSpecification("type", "genetic");
    addSpecification("root", "attractive");
    addSpecification("bonus charisma", 2);
    addSpecification("cost", 2);
    addSpecification("opinion", 5);
}

##### Research System Integration

Traits integrate deeply with the research system in multiple ways:

###### Research Tree Unlocking
Some traits unlock entire research trees, providing access to new 
magical or professional abilities:

~~~c
addSpecification("research tree", "/lib/instances/research/magic/elemental/fire.c");
~~~

This grants access to fire elemental magic research when the trait is acquired.

###### Sustained Research Effects
Sustained traits are maintained by active research and disappear when
the research is deactivated:

~~~c
addSpecification("type", "sustained effect");
addSpecification("triggering research", "/lib/instances/research/magic/enhance/strength.c");
~~~

###### Research Prerequisites
Traits can require specific research to be completed before they can be acquired:

~~~c
addSpecification("research prerequisites", ([
    "/lib/instances/research/magic/basic/elementalism.c": 1,
    "/lib/instances/research/magic/fire/novice.c": 1
]));
~~~

##### Trait Interactions and Conflicts

###### Opposing Traits
Traits can define opposing trait families that create conflicts and cannot coexist:

~~~c
addSpecification("root", "brave");
addSpecification("opposing root", "cowardly");
~~~

Characters cannot have both brave and cowardly traits simultaneously.

###### Opinion Modifiers
Traits affect how NPCs react to characters, creating complex social dynamics:

~~~c
addSpecification("opinion", 15);           // Positive opinion modifier
addSpecification("opposing opinion", -10); // Negative for opposing traits
~~~

NPCs with the same trait root will like the character more, while 
those with opposing traits will like them less.

###### Trait Costs and Character Creation
Traits have point costs that balance their benefits during character creation:

~~~c
addSpecification("cost", 3);    // Positive cost (beneficial trait)
addSpecification("cost", -2);   // Negative cost (disadvantageous trait)
addSpecification("cost", 0);    // No cost (neutral trait)
~~~

##### Special Trait Abilities

###### Extra Attacks
Traits can provide additional attacks per combat round:

~~~c
addSpecification("bonus weapon attack", 1);     // Extra weapon attack
addSpecification("bonus fire attack", 15);      // Fire damage attack
addSpecification("bonus claw attack", 10);      // Natural weapon attack
~~~

###### Weapon Enchantments
Traits can enchant weapons with magical properties:

~~~c
addSpecification("enchantments", ([
    "fire": 10,      // Fire damage
    "magical": 5,    // Magical damage
    "holy": 8        // Holy damage
]));
~~~

###### Expire Messages
Temporary traits can display messages when they end:

~~~c
addSpecification("expire message", "The magical enhancement fades away.");
~~~

##### Trait Management and Lifecycle

###### Adding Traits
Traits are added through the character's trait service:

~~~c
// In character code
object traits = getService("traits");
traits->addTrait("/lib/instances/traits/health/hale.c");
~~~

###### Removing Traits
Traits can be removed when appropriate:

~~~c
traits->removeTrait("/lib/instances/traits/health/hale.c");
~~~

###### Temporary Trait Application
Temporary traits are applied with duration:

~~~c
// Applied with 2-minute duration
traits->addTrait("/lib/instances/traits/effects/haste.c", 120);
~~~

###### Sustained Trait Management
Sustained traits are automatically managed by the research system:

~~~c
// Applied when research is active
// Removed when research is deactivated
// No manual management required
~~~

##### Trait Display and Information Systems

###### Detailed Trait Information
The system provides comprehensive trait information:

~~~c
string details = getDictionary("traits")->traitDetails("hale");
~~~

This displays:
- Trait name and type
- Complete description
- All bonuses and penalties
- Prerequisites and requirements
- Research tree unlocks
- Opinion modifiers
- Cost information

###### Character Trait Listing
Characters can view their traits in organized categories:

~~~c
// In character sheet or traits command
string traitList = traits->traitsDisplay();
~~~

###### Trait Comparison
Players can compare traits during selection:

~~~c
// Compare multiple traits
mapping comparison = traits->compareTraits(({ "hale", "sickly", "hardy" }));
~~~

##### Advanced Trait Features and Mechanics

###### Conditional Traits
Traits can have complex acquisition conditions:

~~~c
// Only available to certain races
addSpecification("race prerequisites", ({ "elf", "half-elf" }));

// Only available with specific research
addSpecification("research prerequisites", ([
    "/lib/instances/research/magic/basic/elementalism.c": 1
]));

// Only available at certain levels
addSpecification("level prerequisites", 15);

// Only available with other traits
addSpecification("trait prerequisites", ({ "brave", "strong" }));
~~~

###### Scaling and Progressive Traits
Traits can improve with character advancement:

~~~c
// Bonus increases with level
addSpecification("scaling bonus", ([
    "attribute": "strength",
    "base": 1,
    "per level": 0.1,
    "maximum": 5
]));

// Bonus increases with skill
addSpecification("skill scaling", ([
    "skill": "long sword",
    "bonus": "weapon class",
    "ratio": 0.2
]));
~~~

###### Trait Synergies and Combinations
Some traits work better together:

~~~c
// Synergy bonuses
addSpecification("synergy traits", ([
    "tactician": (["bonus leadership": 2]),
    "strategist": (["bonus tactics": 3]),
    "military": (["bonus command": 5])
]));
~~~

###### Environmental Trait Effects
Traits can be affected by environment:

~~~c
// Bonuses in specific environments
addSpecification("environmental bonuses", ([
    "forest": (["bonus stealth": 5, "bonus survival": 3]),
    "mountain": (["bonus climb": 4, "bonus endurance": 2]),
    "desert": (["bonus heat resistance": 20])
]));
~~~

##### Trait Persistence and Saving

###### Permanent Trait Storage
Permanent traits are saved with character data:

~~~c
// In character save data
"traits": ([
    "/lib/instances/traits/health/hale.c": ([
        "name": "hale",
        "acquired": time(),
        "bonuses": ({ "bonus constitution", "bonus hit points" })
    ])
])
~~~

###### Temporary Trait Management
Temporary traits are tracked with expiration:

~~~c
// Temporary traits with timers
"temporaryTraits": ({ 
    "/lib/instances/traits/effects/haste.c",
    "/lib/instances/traits/effects/strength.c"
})
~~~

###### Sustained Trait Tracking
Sustained traits are linked to research:

~~~c
// Automatically managed by research system
// No manual persistence required
~~~

##### Trait System Validation

The system validates traits through multiple comprehensive mechanisms:

###### Required Property Validation
All traits must have essential properties:
- name, description, type, root properties must be present
- Valid trait type from validTraitTypes array
- Proper bonus/penalty specifications validated against bonuses dictionary

###### Effect Trait Validation
Effect traits require additional properties:
- duration (for timed effects) must be positive integer
- triggering research (for sustained effects) must be valid research item

###### Bonus System Validation
All bonuses must be validated:

~~~c
object bonusDictionary = getDictionary("bonuses");
bonusDictionary->isValidBonusModifier(bonusToCheck, value);
~~~

###### Conflict Detection
The system prevents conflicting traits:
- Opposing root traits cannot coexist
- Prerequisite validation ensures requirements are met
- Point cost validation maintains character creation balance

This comprehensive traits system provides:
- **Flexibility**: Support for permanent, temporary, and sustained traits
- **Depth**: Complex interactions and synergies between traits
- **Integration**: Seamless connection with combat, research, and social systems
- **Scalability**: Easy addition of new trait types and categories
- **Balance**: Point-based costs and opposing trait mechanics
- **Immersion**: Rich descriptions and meaningful character development

The result is a trait system that enhances character development through
meaningful choices, provides substantial mechanical benefits and penalties,
creates rich roleplaying opportunities, and maintains careful game balance
while allowing for extensive customization and character differentiation.
